        <h1>Khachapuri</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p id="description">Ajarski khachapuri is a boat-shaped Georgian bread with a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center. It's only a matter of time before this fun bread is delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after. This versatile bread takes a little finesse, but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft, chewy bread dipped in runny yolk and molten cheese?</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed, for dusting</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cheese Blend:</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
                <li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
                <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 pats</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make dough: Combine milk, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt; mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While dough rises, prepare cheese blend: Toss together feta, Monterey Jack, and mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl. Refrigerate cheese mixture until needed.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in half. Place 1 dough half on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with flour. Roll out into a rectangle about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/4 of the cheese mixture in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. Roll sides up tightly over cheese, forming a canoe shape. Pinch and twist ends to seal. Trim excess parchment and lift dough onto a baking sheet. Shape and stuff remaining dough half. Fill canoes with remaining cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats butter over each egg, then sprinkle with salt and cayenne. Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to stir butter into egg.</li>
        </ol>
