# odin-recipes

This is my first project created based on The Odin Project course. It consists in creating recipes of favorite dishes using html. The purpose of the project is to test and consolidate the skills acquired in the HTML Foundations section. In addition, the basic skills of working with the Git version control system are also tested.
